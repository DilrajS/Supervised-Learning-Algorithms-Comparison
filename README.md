# Supervised-Learning-Algorithms-Comparison
The last comprehensive evaluation of supervised learning was done in the 90â€™s. 
Since then, multiple different experiments emerged. 
Rich Caruana and Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil conducted their own study (CNM06) in which they compared ten different supervised learning methods. 
Here, I am attempting to replicate their results. However, instead of ten different algorithms, I compared three popular algorithms, which consisted of k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and decision tree. 
I also used various performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods.
